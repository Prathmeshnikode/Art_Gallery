<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to my artistic world! I'm prathmesh, an indan artist. My creative journey has been a whirlwind of colors, emotions, 
    and endless exploration.<br/>

    From an early age, I've been captivated by the magic of visual expression. Whether it was doodling on the margins of my school 
    notebooks or losing myself in the strokes of a paintbrush, art has always been my sanctuary.<br/>
    
    I find inspiration in nature's beauty, urban landscapes, human emotions, etc. 
    These influences infuse my work with a sense of wonder, nostalgia, introspection, etc. inviting viewers to take a step into my 
    perspective.<br/>
    
    Each piece I create is a chapter in the ongoing story of my artistic evolution. I love painting, digital art, sculpture, etc. as they 
    allow me to play with textures, experiment with light and shadow, etc.<br/>
    
    When I'm not lost in the world of creation, you might find me hiking, cooking, reading, etc. These experiences enrich my artistic perspective 
    and remind me that inspiration can be found in the most unexpected places.<br/>
    
    Thank you for visiting my website and taking a glimpse into my artistic journey. I hope my work speaks to you on a personal level 
    and resonates with the emotions I pour into each piece. Feel free to explore my gallery and don't hesitate to reach out if you have 
    any questions, inquiries, or just want to chat about art and life.<br/>
    
    Warmly,<br/>
    Prathmesh</p>
